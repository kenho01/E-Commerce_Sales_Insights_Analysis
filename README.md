# Insights & Analysis on E-Commerce Sales

## Problem Statement
The rise of E-commerce in Singapore had led to an explosion of various online shopping platforms, each offering an array of sales and promotions.
Initially, special occasion sales like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, etc. dominated the E-commerce landscape.
However, the market has since evolved significantly, with a proliferation of frequent sales event such as 10.10, 11.11, 12.12, mid and end-of-month sales.
This frequent and diverse array of sales events has made it difficult for consumers to determine the optimal time to make a purhcase. 

## Objective
To address this challenge, this project focuses on analyzing product details from Zalora, a leading E-commerce platform in Singapore. This project aims to provide insights and analysis on sales trends, enabling consumers to navigate the crowded sales calendar and identify best times to purchase products based on historical data and sales patterns.
